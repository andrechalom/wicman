wicman is a minimalistic WIreless Connection MANager, 
intended to be light-weight, with few dependencies, 
and implement command-line access to wireless networks.

wicman should NOT be used side-by-side with other connection
managers such as NetworkManager, wicd, connman. Stop and disable
these connection managers before starting wicman

Depends:
wicman depends on ruby (tested on 1.9.3), wpa_supplicant, iwlist,
killall and ifconfig. You can install these with:
sudo apt-get install ruby wpasupplicant wireless-tools net-tools psmisc

Features of wicman include:
- FULL Command-line control
- - Possible interface with ncurses? (TODO)
- List available connections
- Connect to hidden network
- Persistent and safe storage of authentication keys
- Configurable list of preferences for ranking connections
- Configurable extensions based on other available programs?
  (dhcpd, rfkill, etc; TODO)
- Autoconnect on connection dropped (TODO)
- Check for internet connection and switch to other available networks
  in case of router failure. (TODO)

How to install
On Debian/Ubuntu, simply run ./install.sh. Then use wicman -h to display
the help.

Why?

I have used wicd in the past, but it's unmantained since 2012 - and it's 
written in Python. Since 2012, architectural changes in some distributions
have introduced (or exposed) bugs in wicd that will not be fixed.

wicman is intended as a small wrapper for wpa_supplicant, which does the 
heavy work of actually connecting to the wireless networks. It provides
only basic functionality, inspired by the KISS philosophy (Keep it Simple
and Straightforward). For instance, DNS servers are managed by 
/etc/resolv.conf, dhcp configurations are managed by dhclient.conf,
and there is no provision for managing these options inside wicman.

Todos:
- drop iwlist for wpa_supplicant interface
- drop killall for pkill (and manage spawned processes pids)
- stop passphrase from being written to disk
- make an option for "show connection status"
- health checks (autoconnect if dropped, change nets if 8.8.8.8 is unreachable)
- option to cleanly shutdown daemon
- extensions
- tidy up install.sh
- option to sort list by Name or Strenght?
- start w/o config file using reasonable defaults
